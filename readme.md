Mineteria Mixin Bootstrapper
============================

**Under development and not stable!**

Allows the application of mixins provided by plugins on Mineteria.

## Building
__Note:__ If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use ./gradlew for Unix systems or Git Bash and gradlew.bat for Windows systems in place of any 'gradle' command.

In order to build MixinBootstrapper you simply need to run the `gradle` command. You can find the compiled JAR file in `./build/libs` labeled similarly to 'MixinBootstrapper-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar'.

[Gradle]: https://www.gradle.org/
